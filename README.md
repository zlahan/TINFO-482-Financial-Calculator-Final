Hello!

Welcome to Ram & Bytes TINFO 482 senior project, the Financial Calculator.

Our project was to create a multi-functional Financial Calculator That can take in a variety of information to produce a resulting chart with details for the selected financial item.

To run this program, first download the file then open up two command prompts and change the directory to the area you saved the file. once you are there, run "npm start" to activate the UI and "node app" to run the database, one prompt for each command.

You will then have access to our program and will be able to utilize the four calculators (Closed-End, Credit Card, Deposit Account, and Mortgage).

Thank you!
